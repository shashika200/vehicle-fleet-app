    *   **Dashboard Screen:** Build a screen to display a real-time list of vehicles.
    *   **Add/Edit Vehicle Screen:** Create a form for creating and updating vehicle records.
5.  **Implement UI/UX Guidelines:**
    *   Apply a consistent blue Material Design theme.
    *   Add loading indicators and user feedback messages.
    *   Set up navigation between screens.
